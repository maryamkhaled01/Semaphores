# Semaphores
Implementing a program to solve a synchronization problem using semaphores.
Problem Statement:
N mCounter threads count independent incoming messages in a system and another thread
mMonitor gets the count of threads at time intervals of size t1, and then resets the counter to
0. 
The mMonitor then places this value in a buffer of size b, and a mCollector thread reads
the values from the buffer.
Any thread will have to wait if the counter is being locked by any other thread. 
Also, the mMonitor and mCollector threads will not be able to access the buffer at the same time or to
add another entry if the buffer is full.
Assume that the messages come randomly to the system, this can be realized if the mCounter
threads sleep for random times, and their activation (sleep time ends) corresponds to an email
arrival. 
Similarly, the mMonitor and mCollector will be activated at random time intervals.
